The assignment:

Please use HTML/CSS to create a webpage to hand in this assignment. This will be deployed through Github Pages. Your submission should include the following:

1. A brief overview of the project. Consider answering the questions: What is the overarching question you are attempting to prove/disprove? How does A/B Testing help you make useful observations on the effectiveness of one design over another?
2. Information about how you changed the given webpage (include an image/gif of b.html showing your modifications)
Your chosen metric of choice.
3. Your three hypothesis pairs (null + alternative with reasoning) for each metric, and your predictions with justification about rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis for each metric (3 total predictions regarding each null hypothesis)
4. Your resulting statistical analysis
5. Computation of each metricâ€™s appropriate statistics (any of: avg, std, t-score, chi^2, p-value) for site versions A and B.
6. For each metric, write which test you chose and why, whether the difference between A and B was statistically significant (referring to important values calculated from the test and what they tell us), and your response to your hypotheses based on your test results (e.g. accept the alternative hypothesis, fail to reject the null hypothesis, etc).
7. Describe what summary statistics might tell you about the data (open-ended, draw some qualitative conclusion
